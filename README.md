# Async/Await & Promises - Learning Project

## Description

This project is designed as a learning exercise to explore the mechanisms of asynchronous JavaScript, specifically focusing on using **Promises**, **async/await**, and handling **HTTP requests**. It demonstrates how these techniques can be applied to manage asynchronous operations and perform API calls efficiently.

## Features

- Practice using Promises to handle asynchronous logic.
- Explore async/await syntax to simplify Promise-based code.
- Make HTTP requests using the `superagent` library to interact with external APIs.
- Demonstrates error handling in asynchronous operations.

## Project Structure

```bash  
├── dog-img.txt            # Text file that is written with the urls for dog images
├── dog.txt                # Text file from which is fetched the dog breed - the file that is read to know what is the breed to include in the api url
├── multiple-promises.js   # Script for handling multiple promises
├── index.js               # Main script with async/await and Promises examples
├── package.json           # Project configuration and dependencies
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

### Languages
- JavaScript (ES6+)

### Frameworks and Technologies
